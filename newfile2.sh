1) git clone https://github.com/nic-instruction/hello-nti-300.git \n
2) cd hello-nti-300 \n
3) Created the file newfile.sh \n
4) git add newfile.sh \n
5) git commit -m \"added a new example file\" \n
6) git push \n
7) Went to the website, refreshed, and the changes came through.  Then created another file via the website called newfile2.sh.  I then went back to my command line copy of the git repository, which was woefully out of date. \n
8) git fetch \n
9) git pull \n
10) I edited newfile2.sh
11) git add newfile2.sh
12) git commit -m \"added useful content to newfile2.sh\" \n
13) git push"
